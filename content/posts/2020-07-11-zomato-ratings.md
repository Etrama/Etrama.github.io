This challenge was a competition hosted within Deloitte, on a platform called `DLabs` with cash prizes for podium finishes. It was a Kaggle style competition with public and private leaderboards. Our team managed to place `Third`.  

I worked on this competition with [Navaneesh Gangala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navaneesh/). I was responsible for cleaning data, validating the integrity of the cleaned data, engineering features, training models, using AutoML and ensembling models, etc.
