### Background
Thanks to our team winning the [2018 Deloitte ML Guild Hackathon](https://etrama.github.io/posts/2018-08-30-guild-hackathon/), I was invited to be a part of a panel of authors with the goal of writing a Whitepaper. This authors on this whitepaper other than myself include: Tami Frankenfeld, Kyle Harbacek, Arunima Gupta, Abhishek Dugar, Sharad Kumar and Devin Cavagnaro.  

The paper was written by a team of 5 people, including me. The paper was published on Deloitteâ€™s internal knowledge platform, called KX. The paper was the most widely read whitepaper on the platform in 2018.

### Temporary Placeholder
My section in the paper dealt with the development of personnel with both business and technical skills, from the moment they started their career and also catering for cases like people who join the organization mid-career. (Co-author)
