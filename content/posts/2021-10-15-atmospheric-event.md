Classified events as either standard background conditions / tropical cyclones or atmospheric rivers. Used techniques such as SMOTE and SMOTE Tomek to fix class imbalance, hyperparameter tuning using HalvingRandomGridSearchCV, manual feature engineering, and a plethora of sklearn classification algorithms. Check out the doc link for a more detailed overview of the project.
