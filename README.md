If you see this page (not in the README.md file but on the actual website), it means that the website is being updated and will be back soon.  

Incidentally, if you happen to encounter the pink unicorn shown below anywhere else, say when you click on certain pages in the website, it means that the page is not ready yet and if you give it 2-3 minutes and try again, it should work.
